But somewhere along the way, that care turned into something deeper. I...I love you, Bella.\"\n\nHis confession leaves you speechless, but the look in his eyes tells you he means every word. \"Jacob,\" you whisper, your heart pounding. \"I love you too.\"\n\nThe rest of the night is a blur of slow dances, whispered confessions, and shared smiles. It's a night you'll remember forever.",

His laughter filled your days, and his arms provided a safe haven at night.\n\nBut one day, the light in Jacob's eyes dimmed, his smiles became less frequent. He grew distant, his warm presence fading like a sunset at the end of the day. His laughter, once the soundtrack of your life, was replaced by silence.\n\n\"Jacob,\" you said one day, 'what's wrong?' He looked at you, his eyes filled with a sadness you'd never seen before. \"I'm sorry, I have to go.\"\n\nAnd just like that, the sun that was Jacob Black began to set. Your world, once filled with warmth and light, was plunged into a cold, endless night. You were left alone, a half without its whole, a heart without its beat.

It lumbers awkwardly towards you and hands you a bouquet of flowers. It seems nice.\n\nYou aren't sure what happened to your previous date, but it appears they've transformed into bees, so you figured you'd make the most of the situation. The swarming mass of bees is quite the charmer and has some sick moves on the dance floor. A slow song comes on and the humming creature extends a hand to you in a flamboyant gesture. You take it, and dance slowly. As you do, you press into the amalgamation of bees, and a few individuals crawl about your hands and face tenderly. You feel their love and warmth.
